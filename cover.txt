mm: cma: introduce a non-blocking version of cma_release()

This small patchset introduces a non-blocking version of cma_release()
and simplifies the code in hugetlbfs, where previously we had to
temporarily drop hugetlb_lock around the cma_release() call.

It should help Zi Yan on his work on 1 GB THPs: splitting a gigantic
THP under a memory pressure requires a cma_release() call. If it's
a blocking function, it complicates the already complicated code.
Because there are at least two use cases like this (hugetlbfs is
another example), I believe it's just better to make cma_release()
non-blocking.

v1:
  - introduce cma_release_nowait() instead of making cma_release()
    non-blocking, for performance reasons
