percpu: memcg memory accounting rework

This patchset reworks memcg-based accounting of the percpu memory:
instead of using two types of chunks (memcg-aware and non-memcg-aware)
it treats all chunks as memcg-aware. An extra memory used for objcg
arrays will is compensated by a better chunks utilization, so the
total memory footprint should be the same or smaller.

First two patches are preparational changes and cleanups on the memcg side.
The third one is percpu accounting rework.

v2:
  - make all chunks memcg-aware instead of on-demand objcg allocation, by Dennis
